# Fun-and-Practice
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy <br>
With that being said - here i collect my random projects i do for fun and practice.  <br>
If you like anything and would like to use it - feel free.  <br>
If you have a more elegant solution to a specific part - please share with me :) <br>
If you want to collab on something - send me a short description of your project and i will see if i have the skills/time for it :) <br>
If you are hiring - I would love to hear about your offer.<br>
